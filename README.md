# Caeser Cipher Decrypter

This application decrypts caesar cipher encrypted information back to its original state by shifting all letters backwards 3 positions in the alphabet, counteracting the original encryption method.

The application itself is interacted with through a tkinter based GUI in which the user can enter text, press a "decrypt" button, and have the decrypted text appear below for ease of use.

The input is decrypted while maintaining non string characters and spaces. All text input and output is in lowercase by converting any capitalisations. Decrypted text is able to be copied to clipbard via button.



Productionisation proposal -

This tool can be converted to a standalone executable for use on other machines and enable widespread use. This application could be stored in an internal repository for download and use by those with appropriate need.

Further improvements to be made before productionisation would include a scroll bar for longer messages and functionality for other encryption methods.
